## Real-time and personalized scoring of customer engagement
#### This is a project that I worked as a consultant for a startup company that provides a client success analytics platform.
#### I am not providing any data file in this repository under the NDA.

#### Three notebooks are included. 
#### 1. Data_processing_and_exploratory_analysis.ipynb --> all the tenant companies (SaaS) were considered. Explored how different features are related to one another.
#### 2. classification_including_comprehensive_features.ipynb --> all the tenant companies were considered. The random forest classifier was used to classify churn and non-churn cases.
#### 3. classification_large_churn_cases.ipynb --> only the tenant companies with high churn number were considered.The recall was significantly improved.
